# URL Shortener with QR Code Generation

This project is a URL shortening service with additional functionality to generate QR codes for the shortened URLs. The backend is built using **Express** and **MongoDB**, while the frontend is developed with **React**. Users can input a long URL, receive a shortened version, and optionally use a QR code to access the shortened URL.
